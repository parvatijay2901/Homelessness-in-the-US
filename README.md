# A Tool to Visually Analyze Homelessness Trends in U.S. Metros

## Introduction
This project outlines a tool developed to empower researchers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local policymakers with comprehensive visual insights into homelessness trends in US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) since 2007. The tool aims to enhance
decision-making and resource allocation in addressing challenges related to homelessness through various associated factors.

## Key Findings
1. Current Challenges
    - Homelessness is idiosyncratic with a mixture of factors likely contributing to the outcome; depending on the city, different factors are associated with it.
    - Current homelessness data is decentralized, as governmental and non-governmental agencies collect and report in numerous unconnected ways.
2. Data Visualization and Integration
    - Aggregates data from 6 government agencies responsible for data such as economic, health, housing, and demographic trends.
    - Interactive visualizations allow users to quickly build national and city homelessness outlooks and direct resources accordingly.
3. Our Homelessness Trends Tool
    - Introduces a user-friendly web-based dashboard providing extensive data from 2007-2020 for roughly 50 largest U.S. metro areas on geographic distribution, demographics, and emerging patterns in homelessness rates.
    - Utilizes advanced analytics to identify city-specific key factors contributing to homelessness.

## Conclusion
The homelessness trends tool is a convenient aide to researchers and policymakers working to address homelessness by understanding recent trends. The tool equips stakeholders with the data needed for targeted interventions in their cities. Collaboration between organizations will have a positive impact on the homeless population in large U.S. metro areas.
